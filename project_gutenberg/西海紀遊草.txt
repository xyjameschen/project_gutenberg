    Transcriber’s Note

There are only two extant copies of /Reminiscences of Western Travels/
(Xi hai ji you cao 西海紀遊草), written by the first Chinese traveler to
the United States in 1849. One is in private hands in China; the other
is housed in the New York Public Library. There are significant
differences between the two. The former was the source of the 1985
revised edition***, published in China, but this eBook is based on the
latter. For further details, please see "Transcriber's
Note, Part 2" and "A note about the author’s names and the book
title's translation" at the end of this document. See also
my online project at http://scalar.usc.edu/works/firstchinesetraveler/.

There are uncommon characters in the Chinese transcription. If they do
not appear on your screen, you will need to download and install a
suitable font. Alternatively, you may refer to the photos of the
original book's pages. Typographical errors in the American newspaper
and periodical reports were not corrected.

第一位遠赴美國遊歷的華人，於1849年著述的“西海紀遊草” [Reminiscences of
Western Travels]， 現今碩果僅存兩個珍本。其中一本，為中國私人收藏；另一
本，是紐約公共圖書館的藏書。兩書之間，有顯著 差別。中國岳麓書社於1985年
出版的校訂本***，是跟據前者編撰，而我的電子書內容則以 後者為藍本
編寫。詳情請參閱本文結尾的英文按語， 及關於作者名
字和書名翻譯的註釋， 亦請瀏覽我的綱頁。

在中文的謄本中，有些罕見的漢字，如果沒有出現在屏幕上，您需要下載安裝合適
的字 體；另一個可行方法是參考原書每頁的照片。至於在美國報刊報道中出現的
排印錯誤，均會原文收錄，不作 更正。

序
吾鄉林君景周，翩翩佳公子也，僑寓鷺門。丁未二月，由粵東起程往花旂，至六月
達其國。越已酉二月，仍返泉州足跡所經，一一紀述，幷託之長句，名曰 《西海紀
遊艸》。以寫其天時人事之變遷，風俗山川之離合，令閱者惝恍迷離，恍如置身絕
域。壯哉斯遊乎！

顧余聞景周性惇篤而家甚貧，白髮在堂，無以爲養。其乘風破浪，孤劍長征，將以
博菽水資而爲二老歡也。其遊不久卽歸，非得已者。不知者乃以此相 夸詫，過矣！

集中所記尊大母節孝事略，語極真摯。而營捄潮州二十六人，身蹈不測，幸得閨秀
雷卽聲以三百金力爲排解，其事尤可傳。夫以景周負權奇俶儻之姿， 何施不可？
而必爲海外之行，以蓄其甘旨。義憤所發，至於從井救人。向非俠女子引手一援，
其欲生入玉門關也，難矣！乃景周至有所不顧，一意孤行，自求其是。卒之吉人天
相，履險如夷，抽身從九萬里歸，家慶團圓，重承色笑。雖景周之智略足以馭之，
亦景周之孝思有以致之乎？

余於景周素未謀面，近其師林伊洛先生以所著大集見示，並屬題識。時余方株守窮
廬，毫無善狀足以仰慰先靈。受而卒業，深羨其逮事二親，能得天倫 之至樂也！
於是乎書。

庚戌歲，伊洛林先生以其門弟子林君景周《西海紀遊艸》見示。其中以駢體摹寫九萬
里人情土俗、物產天時，無不詳 記，使人披閱之下，宛然在目。至於義救潮人，
禮維閨秀，末復述祖妣苦節，表揚當世，此皆至性至情，出於自然，竟成希有僅
事。惜予頻年落魄，良晤 無緣， 竊幸誦君之詩，而喜為天下道也。謹書數語，以
誌鄙懷云爾。

    西海紀遊自序

歲維丁未，月屆仲春爰借東風，遠遊西極。蕭蕭長夜，碧海青天；黯黯離愁，臨形
吊影。衣冠優孟，数十年之去日匆匆；傀儡登場，九萬里之奔波碌碌。感 時撫
景，慘談吟詩；往事聊陳，焉能情巳。于是，譜海市蜃樓，表温柔之佳話；借鏡花
水月，發壯麗之大觀。 曘蓼集茶，苦中之苦；披星帶月，天外重 天。父母倚閭而
望，星霜卽父母之星霜；家人籌数愆期，冷煖殆家人之冷暖。腹如懸磬，午夜不計
饔飧；身似簸箕，風雨飄流蕩跡。千金一飯，王孫容易 豪雄；百結愁腸，絕域難
堪腥臭。鐙如求璧，水甚淘金。年來之心跡迷茫，有誰知巳；此日之關山迢遞，卽
景生愁。鬼氣蛙聲，頻增旅恨；蓬頭垢首，強 啜糟醨。水手跳梁，稱呼夥計 (番
人呼粵人爲夥計) 梢工督令，宛爾將軍 (夷俗出海多權)。伍子吹簫，英雄氣短；
周郎顧曲，兒女情長。梦裏還 家，歡然故里；醒仍作客，觸目紅毛 (夷人多紅毛
藍目)。

四旬航海，驚殊寒暑三更 (記得四十日之洋，而三遷寒暑，因南北廛度之分故
也)；兩閱人生，虛度韶光什二。迴憶牛衣對泣，遊人知有室之乖 (予 初婚未久，
卽辭家外出)；舉頭斗柄頻更，蕩子抱無家之痛。東西夷夏，球地相懸；南北輿
圖，身家背面 (大地旋轉不息，中國之晝卽西洋之夜)。痛 思及此，出涕潸然；逝
者如斯，情深今古矣！

時而寂寞光陰，空仍是色；繼暫逍遥雲漢，醉不關癡。覩環海之連天，天仍連海；
念雙親之思子，子更思親。桴海遠遊，謾笑囊無長物；圖書左右，竟㤀 地不容
錐。水綠山青，遽喜捨舟登彼岸；花明柳暗，來隨飛絮去沿萍。屈指梅萼春芳，不
覺蓮香夏至 (予自二月由廣東起程，至六月方達其國)。

百丈之楼䑓重叠，鐵石參差 (以石為瓦，各家兼竪鐵支，自地至屋頂，以防電患)
萬家之亭榭嵯峨，桅檣錯雜 (學校行店以及舟車，浩瀚而齊整)。 艫舳出洋入口，
引水掀輪 (貨物出口無餉，而入稅甚重。以火烟舟引水，時行百里)；潛踪背負挑
肩，駱䭾馬儎 (無肩挑背負之役)。渾渾則老少安 懷，嬉嬉而男女混雜 (男女出
入，携手同行)。田園為重，農夫樂歲興歌；山海之珍，商賈應墟載市 (每七日為
安息期，則官民罷業)。博古院明鐙 幻影，彩煥雲霄 (有一院集天下珍奇，任人遊
玩，楼上懸鐙，運用機括，變幻可觀)；巧驛傳密事急郵，支聯脉絡。暗用廿六文
字，隔省俄通 (每百 步竪兩木，木上橫架鐵線，以胆礬、磁石、水銀等物，兼用
活軌，將廿六字母為暗號，首尾各有人以任其職。如首一動，尾卽知之，不論政
務，頃刻可通 萬里。予知其法之詳)；沿開百里河源，四民資益 (地名紐約克，為
花旂之大馬頭，番人畢集。初患無水，故沿開至百里外，用大鐵管為水筒，藏于地
中，以承河淄。兼築石室以蓄水，高與楼齊，且積水可供四億人民四月之需。各家
楼䑓暗藏銅管于壁上，以承放清濁之水，極工盡巧。而平地噴水高出数 丈，如天
花亂墜)。酋長與諸夷並集，貴賤無分；白番與黑鬼私通，生成黄種 (土番面赤身
昂，性直而愚。三百年前，英人深入其地，久而家焉。 屡奪亞非利加黑鬼，賣其
地為奴。而禁白黑相配。間有私通者，遂生黃面虬毛之類)。天堂地獄，奉教競
競；贖罪捐軀，超生一一 (西洋諸國多奉耶 穌、天主二教)。

艤海艦舸千里，子母炮連城 (卽天炮也)；坤靈日月旋乾，渾天儀秉鑑 (其人善測
天地度數，雖航海周年不覩山嵐，亦無毫釐之差。如西儒利瑪竇之 天地形說，亦
不及其詳)。郡邑有司，置刑不用 (其法准原、被告各攜狀師，並廿四耆老當堂証
駁，負者金作贖刑，檻作罪刑)；城鄉要害，寓兵于農。 刻字為碑，瞽盲摩讀 (盲
瞽院華麗非常，刻板為書，使盲人摸讀)；捐金置舍，孤寡栽培 (設院以濟孤寡鰥
獨)。車舂水織，功稱鬼斧叢奇；良治書 城，技奪天工靈活 (集板印書，以及舟、
車、舂、織、鎚、鑄等工，均用火煙輪，運以機器，神速而不費力。余獨有志于舟
車之學，可以濟公利私。惟 獨力不支，苟吾人有志共成，不期年可以奏效也)。或
風或雨，暴狂示兆于懸鍼；乍暑乍寒，冷暖旋龜于畫指 (以披璃管裝水銀，為風雨
暑寒針)。 山川人物，鏡中指曰㽞形 (有神鏡，煉藥能借日光以照花鳥人物，頃刻
㽞模，余詳其法)；術数經綸，學校男師女傅 (有閨秀雷卽聲，其同學女友， 見余
恭敬無嫌疑，現為女傅。其書院中有子女自六、七歲至十六、七歲者四百餘人，男
女師長四人，均任其職。每日課定巳、午、未，每禮拜期放學二日， 率此成例)。

一團和氣，境無流丐僧尼；四毒沖天，人有奸淫邪盜 (斯亦不免)。應心得手，創
一技便可成名 (其俗不尚虛文，凢人能首創一藝，足以利世，特加 槳賞)；遠國他
邦，道不同目為愚蠢 (目崇信鬼神、奉祀土木偶者為賤鄙罪人)。四海工商畢集，
阜尓經營；卅省民庶叢生，年增倍蓗。醫精剖割，瞞 人背地開棺 (每省有一醫
館，傳方濟世。凡貧民入其中就醫，雖兔謝金，或病致死，卽剖屍驗病，有不從
者，卽開棺偷驗)；事播新文，衾影難藏聲跡 (大政細務，以及四海新文，日印於
紙，傳揚四方，故官民無私受授之弊)。南圃南農遍地，棉麥秋收；北工北賈居
奇，酒肉兄弟。黑鬼生充下陳，畢 世相承 (英人以黑鬼賣於其地，遂世為賤役。
主人貧，輙轉賣之)；拈䦰眾選賢良，多簽獲荐 (凡大小官吏，命士民保舉，多人
荐拔者得售)。暴強 所擾，八載劳師 (其地原屬英吉利管轄，因征稅繁擾，故華盛
頓出而拒之，遂自爲國，爭霸西洋)；統領為尊，四年更代 (眾見華盛頓有功于
國，遂 立彼為統領，四年復㽞一任，今率成例)。四時土產，物等價昂；半據荒
洲，地寬人少 (其地雖居天下四分之一，然而人民不及中國二省之多。工人少 而
土物貴，理所必然)。

去日之觀天坐井，語属齊東；年來只測海窺蠡，氣吞泰岱。眼界森臨萬象，彩筆難
描；耳開奇怪多端，事珠誰記？潺潺流水，桃源漁子重來；燭燭其華，周 召家人
遺愛 (男女自婚配，宜其有室家之樂矣)。瓜田納履，世復何疑；李下整冠，人無
旁論 (歸舟之出海，主事者每抱客婦在懷，醜態難狀，恬不 為怪)。春風入座，一
言聯靜好之機；宋玉東牆，百禮防範圍之制 (予恒與夷女並肩把臂于月下花前，未
嘗及亂)。嬌藏錦綉，遍地𣰽毺；貌襯玻璃 ，映窓梅雪。桃花上馬，蠻姨領露蝤
蠐；油壁香車，遊女鞭含夕照。依依楊柳，到處垂青；蕩蕩桃花，西秦薄命 (予有
句云: "好花一入行人子，不 揷金樽痛客心")。秋月春芳，難窮幽韻；亀年延壽，
莫繪傾城。詩酒琴棋，堂飛舊燕；𦂶羅書𦘚，醉冩春風 (書𦘚琴棋，玉人各精其
妙)。敢 嘖卿卿，言真咄咄。蠻腰舞掌，輕鴻遠渡重淵 (女友隨凌氏，玉腰纖小，
窈窕可人，恐小蠻見者，應羞婢對夫人)；鶯囀歌檀，玉佩聲來月下 (夷女 雖工諸
藝，予獨取其風琴，手彈足按，音韻鏗鏘，神致飄然)。

時臨乞巧，巧遇潮人；景為玉成，成諸蠻女 (時有潮州澄海人二十六輩，被英商誘
去，舟飄其地，值余哀訴舟中鞭朴以及離別之苦。余爲營救，竟得附 舟歸里。余
之獲交女友雷卽聲，亦根于此，遂主于其家者兩月。噫！予之救火及身，更感其情
多方垂顧。不意平生知巳，竟出于海外之女卽。而余結草啣 環，又在何日？興懷
及此，未嘗不潸然欲涕也。被誘之事，餘詳卷後)。廿六人之隨風飄蕩，苦海無
涯，兩百日之忍氣吞聲，捐生一旦。眾為救歸鼓禍， 遭驅象而送向蛇吞；吾悲同
調相憐，計釣鯉而敺由獺祭。相逢萍水，難辭萍寄他方；無縫天衣，幸獲天緣湊
巧。夷宮會審，臨提難𦘚葫蘆；鮑管分金， 卽日乘機航葦 (于八月廿六日，眾得
返棹)。

天從人願，何妨平地興波；友玉他山，毛秃鵲橋填壑。主人高義，保非罪之拘囚
(因救潮人而鼓禍，蒙女友之父以三百金保余出禁)；彼美多情，喜
驚 鱗之脫網。百八度之星娥繫足，指約盟心 (自厦到其處，恰一百八十度，余感
其情，贈以金指約一枚)；兩閱月之紅拂垂青，玉容表誓 (答以小照)。 淒淒江
草，梦印楊州；浙浙秋天，爐灰畫字 (恒與圍爐夜話)。虽使君有婦，抱痛人天；
慣小姑無郎，心堅金石 (嘗語余以不嫁)。底事華番異 致，黎倩牽心；天然胡婦多
情，子卿誰是？夜繞池塘梦草，孤燈淚漬衾裯；時維覩𦘚呼真，一紙心懸枕蓆。

刻刻關心雙鯉，雲山萬叠無踪；年年作客秦川，面目故吾黧瘦。相思紅豆，𣗳頭空
盻盡寒鴉；溝水長流，葉上只一通錦字 (余在南方九月，只得玉人 一書而巳)。陰
晴渺渺，一殘編昏曉流年，雨雪霏霏，九閱月婆娑牙軸。蠹魚飽蛀，咀嚼華英 (每
譯夷書以解悶) ；禿管餘堆，抹塗鴉字。

時卽凄風苦雨，冐凍尋芳;居恒矮屋炎天，汗蒸流水。深感蘭香割股，饋奉高堂；
减壽祈天，孝慈守節 (在彼追念先祖妣節孝，因作一記，詳卷後)。 音容如在，痛
繞膝之無從；桑梓雖遥，幸歸㠶之迅發。山海竒觀，書眞難罄；椿萱並茂，貧亦何
憂。生逢   盛世，豈甘異域之久居；略敘遊蹤，思補職方之 外紀。情有未盡，複
綴以詩。

    西海紀遊詩

足跡半天下，聞觀景頗奇；因貧思遠客，覓侶往花旗。初發閩南掉，長教徼外馳，
星霜帆作帳，凍餒餅充饑。
游子思親際，原親憶子時；思親虞老邁，憶 子患凄其；妻對牛衣泣，夫從斗柄
移。輿圖看背向，道路悵多歧；
鱗甲爭飛舞，風濤作鼓吹；蜃䑓藏霧社，蛟壑起雲螭；謾嘖船牢久，須憐絕域羇；
岸由 山数轉，春出夏來茲。
宮闕嵯峨現，桅檣錯雜隨；激波掀火舶，載貨運牲騎；巧驛傳千里，公私刻共知；
泉橋承遠溜，利用濟居夷；
戰艦連城炮，渾天測 海蠡；女男分貴賤，白黑辨尊卑；俗奉耶穌教，人遵禮拜
規；聯邦情旣洽，統領法猶垂；
國以勤農富，官從薦舉宜；窮招孤寡院，瞽讀揣摩碑；斷獄除刑 具，屯軍肅令
儀，暑寒針示兆，機織火先施；
土廣民仍少，售昂物只斯；南方寬沃壤，北省善謀貲；少蓄遨游志，今開夙昔疑。
玉堂鋪錦繡，瓊宇襯玻瓈；
秋月彈湘怨，蒼松繪雪姿；才追謝道蘊，慧媲蔡文姬；走筆籠鵞帖，迎𨦟探虎棋；
楼頭鐙變幻，鏡裏影迷離；
算貫毫釐末，談㤀辯駁疲；嫦娥辭碧落，大 士渡銀湄。為釋潮澄禍，俄興楚卞
悲；雷陳交繾綣，縞𥿉結相思；
被揑曾穿牖，爰提至有司；亥初遭禁繫，午末脫拘縻；紅袖援雙手，良朋助一𡕸。
黎明 傷祖餞，甛黑繞塘池；
覩畵卿頻喚，囘書望素絲；簟衾餘淚暈，面目瘦燋黧；纂譯聊温習，耕鋤藉硯菑。
殘篇魚蠹蝕，牙軸禿囊錐。
九月棲鴻鷁，週年傍 栢籬，龍門登印度，猪溷鎖麟兒；磨煉曾如許，頭臚歎殆
而。歸程歡迅速，家慶樂酣嬉；

    救回被誘潮人記

余未離家三月之前，巳聞英商在廣省買一漢船，並招潮州人，意欲歸國，藉竒以獲
利。 迨丁未六月，余甫達花旂，卽見其船泊於港口
候騐。至数日，余卽與同行者下船探眾，詢及始末，方知被英夷
所誘，前曾偽立合約云：欲往爪鴉貿易，以八月爲限，限𣼛聽去留。而後船經其地
而不入，眾方知苦。 然而悔巳晚矣。訢及長洋，数受鞭笞之慘，求死不能，
今而後，苟舟他往，眾等雖死此地亦不與俱矣。因船值逆風，不
得往英，而寄泊於此，幸得遇君， 願垂救之。

同行云，"此處有魯姓者，爲花旂法家第一，苟得其片言隻字，何患不完璧歸趙？"
余是以不辭勞苦，代眾勤訪兩月，因其避暑相左，恐舟他往，未免患 生魚肉。於
是八月中旬，眾卽向英人求歸，而英人見眾心力齊一，亦恐有變，況土人聞漢船
至，爭欲觀之。人與英夷銀錢半枚，始得上船，遍覽日得銀錢 数千，豈肯放歸，
因架誣眾欲謀亂，遂押七人於牢中。

其日，𣼛城之人，紛紛傳揚，是夜潮人之首蟻相者來余寓中，泣訢益慘切，余以未
遇魯姓末如之何。比曉，遂到檻中相探，見有額破足跛、血染征衣 者，不堪卒
視。幸而醫人周顧，余頗心安，姑作善言寬慰之。

至第四日夷官會審，而魯姓適歸，於是並集䑓前，首座一官卽按詞訊問，爾等何故
謀殺船主，從實招來，法不容詐。時余坐於旁列，遂向前代譯始末情 由，並於十
九人中，擇一爲証，卽將文憑當堂譯明，而魯姓亦坐於堂右，指駁英夷，井井有
條。只見英夷戰兢汗下，莫措一詞，而夷官究知其𡚁，遂當堂釋 放七人，觀者欣

    A Great Curiosity Coming to this Port--A Yankee Speculation


      New York Daily Tribune


        February 6, 1847, p.1

It appears that a new visitor may shortly be expected in these parts:

/Novel Speculation/.--An enterprising Yankee at Canton has recently
built a Chinese Junk of 300 tons fitted and rigged entirely after the
Chinese mode, which he intends taking to New York, loading her with
every species of China knicknacs, curiosities, etc. to be sold on board
after arrival off that city. He takes also a Chinese crew, a theatrical
and juggling company, males and females, and everything curious,
illustrative of the manners and customs of the Celestials.

The junk will have canvas sails and a Christian rudder to make her
suitable for the long voyage, but upon arrival at the Narrows, every
thing foreign will be replaced by Chinese articles, mat sails, clumsy
rudder and all, and the junk anchor off the city in her entire oriental
costume and build, where she will remain as a show shop, sale room and
mountebank exhibition. It is expected she will make the passage in five
months.

The cost of the whole affair will be about $30,000, and the “cute”
proprietor will undoubtedly realize a large fortune. After having
exhausted the United States, he has been offered $30,000 to deliver his
junk in England. The Manhattanese will stare as broadly at the strange
sight of a cruiser from the flowery land sailing up their noble river,
as did the aborigines when old Hendrick Hudson astonished their
unsophisticated senses by a display of his Dutch canvas in their bay.
The junks are said to be good sea boats, and nothing worse than delay is
feared in the voyage. We only wonder some one never thought of it before.

THE CHINESE JUNK KEYING.—The Captain and consignees of the Chinese Junk
have made arrangements to exhibit this singular specimen of Chinese
naval architecture to the citizens of New York. She will be up this
morning at 11 o’clock at Castle Garden, where she will be moored and
ready to receive visitors tomorrow, from 6 o’clock, A.M. until 5 ½
o’clock, P.M.—In coming up the Bay she will be decorated with flags
peculiar to her country, and salute the vessels in our harbor.
Particulars hereafter. Get out your half dollars, and prepare to
/Chin-Chin/ Capt. Kellett and have a confab with HESING.

THE CHINESE JUNK--“Have you seen the Chinese Junk?” is the question
addressed to ten thousand people every day, by such of our citizens as
are fortunate enough to have seen this extraordinary vessel, and the
innumerable curiosities of every kind that are to be seen on board of
her   She is visited daily by thousands of our people, and there appears
to be no end to the excitement she has made in our community. She is,
indeed, a novelty, and one hour’s stay on board of her will give a
better insight into Chinese manners and customs, than can be learned in
a library of books.


    The Chinese Junk


      Albany Evening Journal


        August 11, 1847, p.2

This strange craft continues to attract numerous Visitors. Though the
project originated with a Yankee, it was carried out by an Englishman,
who “bought in” for $10,000 premium, after the Junk was ready for Sea.
The Chinese Sailors who are on board complain of ill-usage. They belong
to a Province of China remote from Canton, and were shipped for
a coasting Voyage. After being some weeks at Sea, suspecting foul play,
they refused to work, and the Junk drifted for two days. But the
Proprietor and a few English Sailors arming themselves and taking
advantage of a favorable moment, forced the Chinese to work.
Subsequently they determined to starve themselves to death, and were
nearly three days without food.

After the Junk had been a week or ten days in New York, an American
Gentleman who had resided five years in the place from which these men
came, went on board, and finding that he spoke their language (which
differs from that spoken at Canton) they made their complaint to him.
This gentleman communicated the facts to some Merchants, who called upon
the Junk Proprietor and asked him to pay the Chinese Sailors regular
wages and provide for their return in an American ship.—Their
proposition was at first rejected and resented, but on finding that his
Junk would be libelled and his speculation blown up, the Gentleman
complied, and arrangements are now making for the return of the Men who
were inveigled from their homes.


    The Chinese Junk


      New York Daily Tribune


        August 13, 1847, p.2

THE CHINESE JUNK.--The /Albany Evening Journal/ publishes as its leader
of Wednesday an interesting story about the junk. It seems that somebody
who can talk about the lingo of the Chinamen has been on board and has
learned from them that they have been badly used  In the first place
they say that they were inveigled on board under pretence of a coasting
voyage and that after being some weeks at sea, suspecting foul play,
they refused to work and the junk drifted for two days. But the
proprietor and a few English sailors arming themselves and taking
advantage of a favorable moment, forced the Chinese to work.
Subsequently they determined to starve themselves to death, and were
nearly three days without food. The gentleman in question, according to
the /Journal/, interested some merchants in the matter who compelled the
proprietor to pay the Chinamen full wages and to make arrangements for
sending the men home, although he resisted the proposition when first
made to him.

We are not informed as to the truth of this story, but it seems to us
bear marks of a lively imagination. If it originated with the Chinamen
it is enough to say that they are unequaled liars. Moreover we
understood from Captain Kellett, some time before this gentleman is
alleged to have visited the junk, that the Chinamen were receiving
regular wages as sailors and that his intention was to send them out by
some ship going from New York to China. The only complaint we then heard
on board was from Mr. HESING who, in the confidence of friendly
conversation lamented the violence he had been compelled to do his
domestic affections by leaving his three wives. He did not, however,
charge this upon Capt. Kellett, but upon the unfortunate paucity of
accommodations in the junk for so extensive a family.


    A Chinese Junketing

A CHINESE JUNKETING.--A rather grave disagreemen and some disturbance
took place yesterday, on board the Chinese junk, between Capt. Kellett
and his mate and a portion of the Chinese crew, some of whom, the
captain alleges, have been made discontented by parties who wish to
seduce them from his service. The pecuniary offers held out to them have
unsettled them, but they are too cunning and suspicious to release the
captain from his responsibility in reference to them, and the
consequence has been a disposition to mutiny and riot. They had smoked
opium so freely, during their meditations upon the matter, that the
riotous spirit yesterday obtained the ascendancy, and its first
indication was a demand for the wages, which the captain tendered to the
discontented, and offered them a bonus of twenty dollars if they would
return their original agreements or give him a release in full from all
claims. This they refused to do; and under the excitement of the opium
made a severe attack upon the captain and mate. They were, however,
eventually subdued, and some of the ring-leaders, it is said, were taken
to the police office. We saw two of them evince a similar spirit some
time ago.

While we are writing this, some half dozen of them have passed our
office, on their way from the station house, probably, for examination
on the charge. The poor fellows seem disconsolate enough, and one of
them we saw wiping tears from his eyes. Their names are Assoy, Ayong,
Lonee, Attee, Attoo, Tinding and Corotin; and they were this morning
committed for violently assaulting Edward Rinett, second captain to the
junk.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT--[…]

/The Chinese Junk/.—Mr. Lord, on behalf of Hia Siang, Ung
Fl, Lim Chingal, Khosing Thiam, and 22 others, (26 in all,) seamen of
the Chinese Junk, the Keying, filed a libel against the vessel, claiming
wages from September last, when they started from Whampoa, near
Canton—also for maintenance here during proceedings, and for sufficient
to enable them to procure a passage back to Whampoa (the latter
requiring between $100 and $200 each.) The claim that such was the
agreement for the voyage, which they understood was to be for Batavia or
Singapore, and not to occupy over eight months. Mr. Burr, on behalf of
Capt. Kellet, of the vessel, made objections, but the Court thought the
men had a right to libel the vessel, and show, if they could, that the
wages and allowances are due to them. The order was allowed.

CHINESE JUNK.--This vessel remains in the keeping of the U.S. Marshal of

crew. We do not know how much longer she will remain here, but the
native crew are going home soon in a merchant vessel.

has been settled, the Captain paying $1000 for their passage home.
To-morrow morning the whole crew are expected to attend the Mariners’
Methodist Episcopal Church in Cherry st. On Monday next they are to
leave for the Celestial Empire. The Junk remains.

/Arrest of a Chinaman/.--Sin Ken Chem was arrested, charged with
stealing a quantity of Daguerreotype apparatusses,
belonging to Peter N. Harsley, No. 112 Broadway, valued at $35. It seems
that Sin was in the employ of Mr. Harsley, but whether to learn the art
or not does not appear. On the 1st of September, however, he left,
taking with him the articles in question, probably with the idea of
starting the business in his own country. He was held for examination.


    Seamen's Chaplain for China


      New York Evangelist


        October 7, 1847, p.158

Sailed, on the 4th inst. in the bark Candace, Captain Gardner,
the Rev. Geo. Loomis, commissioned by the American Seamen's Friend
Society to preach the gospel to seamen in the port of Canton. Being "
ready to depart on the morrow," a public meeting was held on the
previous evening in the Allen street Methodist Episcopal church in this
city. It was a meeting of uncommon interest. The Rev. Dr. Peck preached
from Matt. 9: 36, 37, 38. General theme--/the compassion of Christ; the
objects which excited it, and its practical exercise/. In conclusion, he
called attention to the multitudes employed on the sea, wandering,
scattered and shepherdless; and forcibly urged the duty enjoined in the
text.

The Instructions of the Board were given by Mr. Spaulding, one of the
Secretaries of the Society, to which the chaplain made an impressive
response. He had left the home and the friends of his youth, to minister
in the port of Canton to the destitute sailors scattered like sheep. He
had entered upon this work impressed with its importance, not only to
the seamen themselves, but to the millions of China.

Additional interest was imparted to the occasion by the presence of
twenty-six Chinese sailors. They had been brought to these shores
contrary to their expectations and wishes, having shipped on board the
"Junk" for Java, but were landed in New-­York. For the last month they
have been inmates, and under the Christian influence of the Sailor's
Home. About to depart on the morrow in the same vessel with the
chaplain, there was an appropriate­ness in their public recognition, and
their being commended to God in prayer. Lin King Chew, a converted
Chinaman, who remains in this country, gave them a parting address, in
which, as he has since explained, he exhorted them to be good, and told
them about Jesus and heaven.

On Monday, the day being delightful, they were accompanied on board the
Candace, and as far out as Sandy Hook, by the officers of the American
Seamen's Friend Society, and other friends. Some of the owners of the
bark, who have generously given the chaplain his passage, were also on
board.

Before parting, the captain, officers and crew, with the brother beloved
who has gone as a chaplain to that distant port, were commended to the
care of Him who controls the winds and the waves.

When last seen, with all sails set, they were bounding over the waves
towards China.

ARREST OF A CELESTIAL.--Lin King Chew was arrested, charged with

LING KENG CHOW.--The Chinaman, who came over as a teacher to Rev. Dr.
Cummings, missionary, was arrested, two or three weeks since, on a
charge of stealing some Daguerreotype apparatus. It is said, however,
with how much truth we know not that the accused bartered some things of
Chinese manufacture for the articles in question, which were found in
his trunk. The alleged owner of the Daguerreotype apparatus now admits,
it is said, having received the Chinese things but contends that they
were presents. It is to be hoped that at the trial, which for some cause
was postponed on Saturday, the Court will see that the stranger in a
strange land has justice done to him, and if it should appear that he
obtained the apparatus by barter, even though he may possibly have got
the best of the bargain, that his rights will be protected and amends
made to him for the accusation and imprisonment. We put this
hypothetically, of course, being unacquainted with the whole
particulars.  [Com. Adv.

SAILING OF THE CHINESE SAILORS, BELONGING TO THE COCHIN CHINA JUNK.--The
return of the Chinese sailors to their native land, in the bark Candace,
Capt. Gardiner, on Monday, the 4th of October, having been arranged by
the owners of the Chinese junk, they all attended the Floating Church of
this city, on the preceding Sunday afternoon. It was interesting to see
them there with the large number of other sailors who were then present,
as some of them must come within the range of Bishop Boone's mission on
their return to Shang-Hai,--and the impression of the church services
could not fail of being remembered, and of producing a solemn effect on
their minds. They were accompanied by Mr. Lin-King-Chew, a devoted
Christian, as far as he understands Christianity, having
embraced our religion through the instrumentality of some faithful
missionary in his native land. His efforts in behalf of his countrymen,
were chiefly directed to their spiritual welfare. He presented each of
them a Testament in their own language, a portion of which he daily read
and explained to them, while they were boarding at the Sailor's Home.
Mr. Lin-King-Chew is a Chinese gentleman of education, and of
distinction and property in his own country, who has been in New York
about two months, learning our language, and who, since their
difficulties, has very much interested himself in their welfare. Capt.
and Mrs. Richardson, of the New York Sailor's Home in Cherry street,
where they have been residing the last three weeks, at their request
also accompanied them. From the paternal and maternal care they have
experienced from them, they have expressed themselves, through their
interpreter, in strong terms of gratitude. After divine service, Rev.
Mr. Parker, the chaplain, presented each of them, 26 in number, with the
Protestant Churchman of April, 1845, which contains two beautiful wood
cuts, originally engraved for the Ladies' Magazine, of a view of the
exterior and interior of the Ploating Church of this city, accompanied
by an extended description of the Floating Church, and the efforts
making in the Episcopal Church throughout America for the spiritual
benefit of seamen. It was an impressive reflection, said Rev. Mr.
Parker, (in a short statement he made to the congregation, after the
benediction,) of the present circumstances of the interesting strangers
who were then present, and who were to leave our shores on, the morrow,
in the ship that lay alongside of the Floating Church, where they were,
for cities under our feet on the other side of the globe, that though
they saw before them persons who excited a deep curiosity, from their
peculiar complexion, mode of dress and physiognomy, that they belonged
to a race which, in numbers, at the present time, equalled one-third of
the whole population of our earth.

On Monday, at 9 o'clock, the deck of the bark Candace was covered with
ladies and gentlemen, and clergymen of several religious denominations,
viz: Rev. Mr. Kidder, of the Methodist communion, Rev. Messrs. Spaulding
and Loomis, Secretaries, and Rev. Mr. Parker, all members of the board
of managers of the American Seamen's Friend Society, and their devoted
friend and countrymen, Lin-King-Chew, who has been untiring in his
kindness to them, in order to accompany them to Sandy Hook. Professor
Loomis, the missionary to seamen in the port of Canton, recently
appointed by that Society, was also there. A deeply affecting incident
was there witnessed. During the progress through the Narrows to sea, a
deputation from the Chinese sailors was sent by them to Capt. and Mrs.
Richardson, then on board, begging them to take their friend and
countryman, Lin King-Chew, to their house, the Sailor's Home in Cherry
street, and take care of him while he was in America, as he was in a
land of strangers, and they felt so much love towards their friend, that
they could not leave him behind, unless they were sure he would be with
those whose sympathy and kindness they had so recently experienced. It
was truly an oriental idea expressed by one. He wished to take with him,
and plant in China, the American "cry tree,"--meaning the willow, for he
could not leave them without crying, and as it grew, he would be
constantly reminded of his feelings when he left America.

The wind being light and ahead, it was necessary for the steamer Jacob
Bell to take the Candace out as far as the lightship, 10 miles beyond
Sandy Hook, and 23 miles from the city, that she might have a good
offing. On reaching this distant place from the shore, it was observed
that a little bird had left N. York with the ship, and was now perched
on the end of one of the spars aloft, as if intending to make the voyage
with her and the Chinese sailors to their homes.

Before the steamer left her, at the request of Capt. Gardiner, after the
crew had been all assembled near the captain, and the Chinese sailors
were arranged, Rev. Mr. Parker commended her crew, passengers, the
Chinese sailors, with the Rev. missionary on board, to God's protection,
in the beautiful prayer of the Liturgy for persons going to sea,
concluding with the Lord's prayer and the benediction.

While the steamboat was sheering away, and the ship, in full sail, was
hauling off, to hasten on her voyage, her bulwarks were lined by the 26
Chinese sailors, in tears at parting with their kind friends, Capt. and
Mrs. Richardson, and their beloved countryman, Lin-King-Chew, whom they
almost worshipped for his many acts of generosity, sympathy and
friendship. The scene was truly worthy of an artist's pencil. The whole
rail on the starboard side was lined with the swarthy figures of these
bare-headed Mongolians, shaking their hands in the air, and looking
towards the steamboat. The caps of the crew were flourishing aloft
behind them, as they gave their three cheers, which were answered by the
ladies waving their handkerchiefs, and the response of the gentlemen.
When these had ceased, the Chinese sailors struck up their farewell
song, which continued, in their harsh, cracked voices, till both vessels
were so far separated that the sound died on the air.

In one hour a small speck on the horizon was all that was seen of the
bark Candace and her interesting passengers. On the steamboat's return,
her services were requested, by a signal set under the jib-boom of a
ship aground, within the Hook, which for 24 hours had made ineffectual
efforts by sails, and, as soon as it could be produced, by another
steamboat, to get off. After breaking several large hawsers, and two
hours' hard straining with steam, the Jacob Bell succeeded in hauling
her off, and the passengers who accompanied the Candace reached the city
at 6 o'clock in the evening.--/Express/.

shu 走向世界丛书 [From East to West: Chinese Travellers Before 1911],
edited by Zhong Shu He 钟叔 河, Yang Guo Zhen 杨国桢, and Zuo Bu Qing,
左步青, [vol 1], yue lu shu she 岳麓书社, 1985, pp.9-63.

Editors of this book (thereafter "the 1985 revised edition") used a
privately-owned copy in China, which according to them passed down from
the author to his family. One of the editors, Yang, discovered this
obscure book in 1980 and, with his co-editors, edited and introduced it
to the public in China and beyond. Without the 1985 revised edition, I,
like others, would not have known this early Chinese traveler to the
West and his interesting encounters, which include his observations of
American society and technology, his rescue of 26 Chinese sailors from
their abusive captain in New York, and his subsequent legal trouble.

Yet, even with this highly accessible 1985 revised edition, this eBook
is worth producing for three reasons:

*1)* Editors of the 1985 revised edition substantially but silently
revised the original text. To be sure, the transcription of the
classical text into simplified Chinese, the new paragraphing, and the
addition of punctuation are not unique to this edition but are standard
practices in the reproduction of classical works in China. However, many
of the silent editorial changes are questionable, including the
substitution of "offensive" words (e.g. 夷 [barbarian] was changed to 洋
[foreign]); the replacement of variant characters; the “correction” of
“wrong” information; and, above all, the change of the author’s name
from 林綤㿝 (as printed in his original text) to 林鍼 without any
editorial note. This kind of editorial changes may prevent the reader
from appreciating the original publication’s historicity and nuances.

*2)* Besides the extant copy used by the editors of the 1985 revised
edition, there is actually another one housed in the New York Public
Library. Both are the traveler's original publications but
there are significant differences between them. The 1985 revised
edition's source, published in around 1867, has more front and end
matter supplements, penned by the author's friends and supporters: an
illustration, four pieces of complimentary remarks 題記, five forewords
序, twenty complimentary poems 題詩, and five postscripts 跋. By
contrast, this eBook’s source, published much earlier in about 1850,
does not have any illustrations, complimentary remarks or poems, and it
only has two forewords and two postscripts. In fact, one of the
forewords in this eBook’s source appears as a postscript in the 1985
revised edition’s counterpart. This may lead us to believe that the
original publication had more than one edition, each of which might have
different combinations of front and end matter supplements. This also
confirms that this eBook’s source predated the 1985 revised edition’s
counterpart since the latter includes supplements written and added
after the publication of the former.

*3)* Although the 1985 revised edition has marginal annotations, a name
index, and a glossary of proper noun translations to provide contextual
information, it lacks any references to American primary sources that
provide contemporary accounts of events related to the author’s
encounters in the United States. Without these American newspaper and
periodical reports, we would not even know that the author was called
"Lin King Chew" (and by other transliterated names) in the United
States; nor would we know the exact people and institutions his travel
book refers to—let alone the wider context of his travel experiences.

This eBook, while building on the 1985 revised edition, takes a
different approach. I hope to provide access to the original publication
with less editorial mediation but more American context. My eBook,
therefore, provides not only a transcription as faithful to the original
book as digitally possible, but also pictures of each of its pages. Also
included are select American press reports with hyperlinks to relevant
parts of the traveler's account.

    A note about the author’s names and the book title's translation

The author calls himself 林綤㿝景周 (Lin Shao Xiang Jin
Zhou) or 林綤㿝 (Lin Shao Xiang) in his book, but those who
wrote supplements simply call him [林]景周 ([Lin] Jin Zhou)
. However, without any editorial note, the 1986 revised edition replaces
林綤㿝 (Lin Shao Xiang) with 林鍼 (Lin Zhen or Lin Qian) as the author's
name. The latter does NOT appear in the original publication on which
this eBook is based. To stay true to the author, I keep 林綤㿝 (Lin Shao
Xiang) as his name.

Lin probably used the transliterated name “Lin King Chew” when he
traveled to the United States. This name appears in several American
press reports of the time, and it is phonetically close to one of his
Chinese names, 林景周 (Lin Jin Zhou). The front cover of this eBook’s
source has an inscription of another transliterated name: "Lin Kung
King"; however, the Chinese counterpart for this transliteration, 林君
景, is not the author's correct name. I therefore adopt "Lin King Chew"
as the author’s English name for this eBook. However, please note that
American newspapers and periodicals of the time used other incorrectly
transliterated names for Lin, including, for example, "Ling Keng Chow"
and "Sin Ken Chem."

As for the book title, the front cover has an inscription of its English
translation: “Reminiscences of Western Travels.” I do not know if it was
Lin’s translation, which was a possibility. Since this is a good
translation, I use it for this eBook’s English title.
